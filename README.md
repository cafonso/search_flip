# ElasticSearch

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mrkamel/elastic_search.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mrkamel/elastic_search)

Using the ElasticSearch gem it is dead-simple to create index classes that
correspond to ElasticSearch indices and to manipulate, query and aggregate
these indices using a chainable, concise, yet powerful DSL. Finally, the
ElasticSearch gem supports ElasticSearch Server 1.x, 2.x, 5.x. Check section
[Feature Support](#feature-support) for version dependent features.


```ruby
CommentIndex.search("hello world", default_field: "title").where(visible: true).aggregate(:user_id).sort(id: "desc")

CommentIndex.aggregate(:user_id) do |aggregation|
  aggregation.aggregate(histogram: { date_histogram: { field: "created_at", interval: "month" }})
end

CommentIndex.range(:created_at, gt: Date.today - 1.week, lt: Date.today).where(state: ["approved", "pending"])
```

## Reference Docs

See [http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mrkamel/elastic_search](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mrkamel/elastic_search)

## Install

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'elastic_search'
```

and then execute

```
$ bundle
```

or install it via

```
$ gem install elastic_search
```

## Config

You can change global config options like:

```ruby
ElasticSearch::Config[:environment] = "development"
ElasticSearch::Config[:base_url] = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
```

Available config options are:

* `index_prefix` to have a prefix added to your index names automatically. This
  can be useful to separate the indices of e.g. testing and development environments.
* `base_url` to tell ElasticSearch how to connect to your cluster
* `bulk_limit` a global limit for bulk requests
* `environment` tells ElasticSearch the current environment. This is used to
  e.g. automatically refresh an index when indexing/deleting records in test
  environment.

## Usage

First, create a separate class for your index and include `ElasticSearch::Index`.

```ruby
class CommentIndex
  include ElasticSearch::Index
end
```

Then tell the Index about the type name, the correspoding model and how to
serialize the model for indexing.

```ruby
class CommentIndex
  include ElasticSearch::Index

  def self.type_name
    "comments"
  end

  def self.model
    Comment
  end

  def self.serialize(comment)
    {
      id: comment.id,
      username: comment.username,
      title: comment.title,
      message: comment.message
    }
  end
end
```

Please note, ElasticSearch (the server) allows to have multiple types per
index. However, this forces to have the same mapping for fields having the same
name even though the fields live in different types of the same index. Thus,
this gem is using a different index for each type by default, but you can
change that. Simply supply a custom `index_name`.

```ruby
class CommentIndex
  # ...

  def self.index_name
    "custom_index_name"
  end

  # ...
end
```

To specify a custom mapping:

```ruby
class CommentIndex
  # ...

  def self.mapping
    {
      comments: {
        properties: {
          # ...
        }
      }
    }
  end

  # ...
end
```

Then you can interact with the index:

```ruby
CommentIndex.create_index
CommentIndex.index_exists?
CommentIndex.delete_index
CommentIndex.update_mapping
```

index records (automatically uses the bulk API):

```ruby
CommentIndex.import(Comment.all)
CommentIndex.import(Comment.first)
CommentIndex.import([Comment.find(1), Comment.find(2)])
CommentIndex.import(Comment.where("created_at > ?", Time.now - 7.days))
```

query records:

```ruby
CommentIndex.total_entries
# => 2838

CommentIndex.search("title:hello").records
# => [#<Comment ...>, #<Comment ...>, ...]

CommentIndex.where(username: "mrkamel").total_entries
# => 13

CommentIndex.aggregate(:username).aggregations(:username)
# => {1=>#<ElasticSearch::Result doc_count=37 ...>, 2=>... }
...
```

delete records:

```ruby
# for ElasticSearch 2.x, the delete-by-query plugin is required for the
# following query:

CommentIndex.match_all.delete

# or delete manually via the bulk API:

CommentIndex.match_all.find_each do |record|
  CommentIndex.bulk do |indexer|
    indexer.delete record.id
  end
end
```

## Advanced Usage

The ElasticSearch gem supports even more advanced usages, like e.g. post
filters, filtered aggregations or nested aggregations via simple to use
API methods.

### Post filters

All relation methods (`#where`, `#where_not`, `#range`, etc.) are available
in post filter mode as well, ie. filters/queries applied after aggregations
are calculated. Checkout the ElasticSearch docs for further info.

```ruby
query = CommentIndex.aggregate(:user_id)
query = query.post_where(reviewed: true)
query = query.post_search("username:a*")
```

Checkout [PostFilterableRelation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mrkamel/elastic_search/ElasticSearch/PostFilterableRelation)
for a complete API reference.

### Aggregations

The ElasticSearch gem allows to elegantly specify nested aggregations,
no matter how deep:

```ruby
OrderIndex.aggregate(:user_id, order: { revenue: "desc" }) do |aggregation|
  aggregation.aggregate(revenue: { sum: { field: "price" }})
end
```

and once more, the relation methods (`#where`, `#range`, etc.) are available in
aggregations as well:

```
OrderIndex.aggregate(average_price: {}) do |aggregation|
  aggregation = aggregation.match_all
  aggregation = aggregation.where(user_id: current_user.id) if current_user

  aggregation.aggregate(average_price: { avg: { field: "price" }})
end
```

Checkout [AggregatableRelation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mrkamel/elastic_search/ElasticSearch/AggregatableRelation)
as well as [AggregationRelation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mrkamel/elastic_search/ElasticSearch/AggregationRelation)
for a complete API reference.

### Suggestions
### Highlighting
### Advanced Relation Methods

source, scroll, profile, preload, includes, find_in_batches, find_each, failsafe

## Non-ActiveRecord models

The ElasticSearch gem ships with built-in support for ActiveRecord models, but
using non-ActiveRecord models is very easy. The model must implement a
`find_each` class method and the Index class needs to implement
`Index.record_id` and `Index.fetch_records`. The default implementations for
the index class are as follows:

```ruby
class MyIndex
  include ElasticSearch::Index

  def self.record_id(object)
    object.id
  end

  def self.fetch_records(ids)
    model.where(id: ids)
  end
end
```

Thus, simply add your custom implementation of those methods that work with
whatever ORM you use.

## Feature Support

`#post_search` and `#profile` are only supported from up to ElasticSearch
Server version >= 2.

## TODO

1. Remove ActiveSupport dependencies

* `Hash#except` (can probably be removed)
* `Module#delegate`
* `Object#present?`
* `Object#blank?`

2. Add convenience mixin for re-indexing ActiveRecord models on callbacks

3. Documentation

4. Switch to httpary or http-rb and use custom exceptions

5. First class support for `nested`, `has_parent` and `has_child` queries

6. Support collapse
