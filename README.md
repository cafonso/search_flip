[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mrkamel/elastic_search.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mrkamel/elastic_search)

## Reference Docs

See [http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mrkamel/elastic_search](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mrkamel/elastic_search)

## Non-ActiveRecord models

The ElasticSearch gem ships with built-in support for ActiveRecord models, but
using non-ActiveRecord models is very easy. The Index class needs to implement
`Index.record_id` and `Index.fetch_records`. The default implementations are as
follows:

```ruby
class MyIndex
  include ElasticSearch::Index

  def self.record_id(object)
    object.id
  end

  def self.fetch_records(ids)
    model.where(id: ids)
  end
end
```

Thus, simply add your custom implementation of those methods that work with
whatever ORM you use.

The model must implement a `find_each` class method.

## TODO

1. Remove ActiveSupport dependencies

* `Hash#except` (can probably be removed)
* `Module#delegate`
* `Object#present?`
* `Object#blank?`

2. Add convenience mixin for re-indexing ActiveRecord models on callbacks

3. Documentation

4. Switch to httpary or http-rb and use custom exceptions

5. First class support for `nested`, `has_parent` and `has_child` queries
